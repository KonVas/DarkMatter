# DarkMatter

The project uses data generated by the Cern [opendata](http://opendata.cern.ch/getting-started/CMS) offline system, that analyses [physics objects](http://opendata.cern.ch/about/CMS-Physics-Objects).

Instructions how to run the examples in order to generate analysis files can be found in the links above. To use the data I generate a json file that contains the analysis of the physics object, the json file then is read in SuperCollider that sonifies the data.
