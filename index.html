<p>Dark Matter is a live coding project involving the sonification of particle physics data.
It is a collaboration of the <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/ea-studios/research/beer.aspx">BEER laptop ensemble</a> (University of Birmingham)
and the <a href="artcms.web.cern.ch">art@CMS</a> project at CERN. Experimental data containing clues towards possible "new physics"
becomes the raw material for improvised music and visualisations programmed in real time by the ensemble
with an aim to creating a result that, beyond being aesthetically engaging, is both musically and scientifically meaningful.
From a broader perspective, this research contributes on the ongoing dialogue between art-science and technology,
and improves the accessibility of big scientific data illustrating its utilisation to inform aspects of artistic and musical practice,
and at the same time acts as cultural transmitter of uncharted concepts to the general public and the interested layman.</p>

<p>BEER' retreat this summer was hosted by the Athens based artists' collective Media Electronique.
The group focussed in refinements and further developments of the code while enjoying the natural landscape of Koumaria, a few minutes outside the city of Sparta, Greece.
More information about the residency can be found at this <a href="http://medeaelectronique.com/koumaria/">link</a>. The residency culminated in a BEER day at the American College of Greece, including a talk and a concert.

<a id="tedx-talk" class="anchor" href="#tedx-talk" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TEDx Talk</h1>

<p>How can real physics data from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN be converted into electronic music? In this talk, Dr.Konstantinos Vasilakos, member of the Birmingham Ensemble for Electroacoustic Research (BEER), and Dr. Angelos Alexopoulos, member of the CMS Communications Group at CERN, present Dark Matter,
an on-going project that is part of a recent SciArt collaboration between the art@CMS program and BEER.
The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqnWPNiu9jI">talk</a> exemplifies how open data can be used in creative ways to inspire the public and especially young people to understand the trans-formative power of science, technology and innovation in our lives.
