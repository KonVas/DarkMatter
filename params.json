  "body": "# DarkMatter\r\n\r\nDarkMatter is a live coding project involving live sonification of experimental particle physics data. It is a collaboration between the Birmingham Ensemble for Electroacoustic Research and the Art@CMS project at CERN in Switzerland. Experimental data containing clues towards possible ‘new physics’ becomes the raw material for improvised music and visualisations programmed in real time by the ensemble with an aim to creating a result that, beyond being aesthetically engaging, is both musically and scientifically meaningful. From a broader perspective, this research contributes on the ongoing dialogue between art-science and technology, and improves the accessibility of big scientific data illustrating its utilisation to inform aspects of musical performance, while in the same time, acts as cultural transmitter of advanced physics to the general public and the interested layman.",
