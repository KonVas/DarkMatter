  "body": "#DarkMatter\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/KonVas/DarkMatter/blob/gh-pages/images/BEER.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\nDarkMatter is a live coding project involving the sonification of particle physics data. It is a collaboration of the [BEER laptop ensemble](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/ea-studios/research/beer.aspx) (University of Birmingham) and the [art@CMS](artcms.web.cern.ch) project at CERN. Experimental data containing clues towards possible \"new physics\" becomes the raw material for improvised music and visualisations programmed in real time by the ensemble with an aim to creating a result that, beyond being aesthetically engaging, is both musically and scientifically meaningful. From a broader perspective, this research contributes on the ongoing dialogue between art-science and technology, and improves the accessibility of big scientific data illustrating its utilisation to inform aspects of artistic and musical practice, and at the same time acts as cultural transmitter of uncharted concepts to the general public and the interested layman.",
