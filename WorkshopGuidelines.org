** Sonify Particle Physics data using SuperCollider
First we need to set up the computer to run the necessary software.
+ Download [[http://supercollider.github.io/][SuperCollider]].
+ Download [[https://github.com/muellmusik/Utopia][Utopia]] and put it in the SuperCollider Extension folder, in MacOS this is ~/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions (create it if not there).
+ Download Dark Matter code [[https://github.com/KonVas/DarkMatter/tree/DarkMatter-Workshop][here]], and move the DarkMatterPatterns.scd file in Extensions folder.

After you have done all this restart SuperCollider.

** Start Dark Matter software
Now that you have installed all the software in your computer, take a ride on how to sonify the data.
+ Open _Utopia Startup.scd_ in the SuperCollider IDE, which is found in the Dark Matter folder downloaded from the link above.
+ Open _Basic Set Up Solo.scd_ and run the first region enclosed in brackets, this will take some time.
+ Then run the next region, if everything went alright you must now see a window with various representations of the data.
+ Each line of value represents a different event, to select an event just click on it on the right of the window where all events are listed.

** Start your engines
Open _SynthDefs.scd_ file, load all the contents, this will open another window listing the /players/ of the synths, to start one press Play!

** Initial guidelines
To explore the different events listed in the interface of the software, just select another event and see how this changes the sound.
If you want you can change the content of the =Pdefs= too, but be careful not to mess with control settings, such as amp (amplitude), cause this might yield in unexpected volume levels.
For example, this code snippet below provides access in the data using =PjetS= pattern, which in turn controls the =frequency= control of a synth.
#+BEGIN_SRC sclang
Pdef(\vinty, Pbind(\instrument, \vint,
\amp, 0.3,
\freq, PjetS(Prand((0..9), inf), \pt).linlin(0, 1, 120.0, 220.0),
\dur, Pconstituent(0, Prand([0, 2, 4], inf), \pt) * 0.1 + 0.1).trace);
#+END_SRC

This project is a collaboration netween the Birmingham Ensemble for Electroacoustic Research and the art@CMS, at CERN in Switzerland.
